## Overview

### Usage

> **Note**: prerequisites
> - [Node.js LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Running the following commands should allow you to generate restorable content from your Botmock project.

- `git clone https://github.com/Botmock/botmock-lex2-export.git`
- `cd botmock-lex2-export`
- `npm install`
- `mv ./sample.env ./.env` and edit `.env` to contain your token and project ids
- `npm start`

The export is going to create an output folder.


### Botmock Project Structure

To translate Botmock projects into lex 2 project, we make certain assumptions about Botmock project structure:

- Intents should be used on connectors in the flow as often as is meaningful. Doing so helps the script break
  up responses and put them under respective intent triggers

- When using quick replies or suggestion chips in a project, some intent utterances should be designed to exactly match the content of the options in the content block.

### Approach to using the out in Lex 2

Simply make a zip file of output folder generated by the exporter and upload the zip file in lex 2 console.
